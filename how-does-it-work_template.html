      <h1>Getting started is <b>super</b> simple. Hear us out.</h1>
      <div class="steps_container">
        <div class="step">
          <h2>1. Sign up using <i>BankID</i> &#129305;</h2>
          <p>
            First, download the <a href="https://www.google.com/">Plonka app</a>.
            With BankID, you can sign all the necessary forms in a matter of minutes.
            Since Plonkers are paid based on their performance,
            you can start or stop working whenever you want - no strings attached. &#128175;
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don't love working with us,
            your account will be terminated automatically after 6 months of inactivity
             - you don't have to do a thing!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
          <h2>2. Gear up and get Plonking! &#129508;</h2>
          <p>
            You don't need anything more than a smartphone on a lanyard around your neck and a dataplan to get started -
            but you may want to wear working gloves and warm clothes.
            Start up the app and set your sights on the closest clean-up zone. &#128640;
          </p>
          <p>
            Start your clean-up session once you've entered the zone. Your phone will track your location and record a low-resolution video of
            your session. Dispose of your collected trash in a public bin,
            end your session, and get paid 50 SEK per filled bag.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
          <h2>3. Payday &#128526;</h2>
          <p>
            By the 25th each month, you'll receive your well-earned balance.
            Since you are employed by us, we handle all the paperwork,
            and you don't have to worry about reporting taxes.
            Can't get any simpler, right? And guess what - you're making a difference for the local environment! &#127795;
          </p>

        During your first five sessions, collecting litter in any regular sized plastic bag will do.
        If you want to continue after this, we will provide you with a free starter kit containing individually numbered Plonka-branded
        environmentally-friendly plastic bags as well as your choice of working gloves or a picker.

      <h1>Who pays for all this?</h1>
      <div class="text_columns">
        <p>Don't worry - we're not here to rip you off. You won't get rich,
          but Plonka is a really quick way for you to get a legitimate job -
          no language skills or previous experience required.
          Our goal is to get sponsored from a variety of environmentally conscious superstars,
          such as the local government, companies working on their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), and donations from local eco-ninjas.
        </p>

        <p>
          And why would they want to pay for someone to pick up litter, you ask? Simple - providing social benefits
          is expensive, and this is a scalable way of providing jobs for pretty much any able-bodied nature-lovers.
          Additionally, it keeps the local neighborhood clean and safe, both for pets and local wildlife, decreases
          local poverty, and provides a sense of responsibility for the local environment.
          So, instead of donating a half a goat (the front or the back, I wonder..?) to a family in
          a developing, why not help someone closer, while also keeping your neighborhood clean?
        </p>

        <p>
          The Plonka founders get paid for the time they put in, but this initiative is not meant to be a
          venture-backed unicorn headed for the stars - we just want to make the world a slightly more fair place.
          In order to do this, we reserve a maximum of 10% for our own salaries, marketing, and keeping the initiative running -
          everything else will go to our Plonkers! We aren't completely bonkers, we promise.
