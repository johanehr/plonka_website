      <h1>Plonker Heroes</h1>
      <p>INSERT USER STORIES HERE</p>

      <h1>Getting started is <b>super</b> simple. Hear us out.</h1>
      <h2>1. Sign up using <i>BankID</i> &#129305;</h2>
      <p>With BankID, you can sign all the necessary forms in a matter of minutes.
        Since Plonkers are paid based on their performance,
        you can start or stop working whenever you want - no strings attached.
        You'll automatically get paid by the 25th of every month. &#128175;
        If you don't love working with us,
        your account will be terminated automatically after 6 months of inactivity.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Gear up and get Plonking! &#129508;</h2>
      <p>
        You don't need anything else than a smartphone on a lanyard around your neck to get started -
        but you may want to wear working gloves and warm clothes.
        Sign in on the <a href="https://www.google.com/">Plonka app</a>, and
        set your sights on the closest Plonka clean-up zone &#128640; - sponsored by the local government, an environmentally
        conscious company, or even your friendly neighborhood eco-ninja. &#128125;
      </p>

      <p>
        Start your clean-up session by pressing the big "Get Plonking!" button that
        should have appeared once you entered the zone. Now, your phone will track your location and record a low-resolution video of
        your session, to prove that you're cleaning up the world. Once you've disposed of your collected trash in a public bin,
        you can end your session, you'll get paid 50 SEK per filled bag.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Payday &#128526;</h2>

      <p>
        By the 25th each month, you'll have received the balance you've worked hard for.
        Since you are actually employed by us, we handle all the paperwork,
        and you don't have to worry about reporting taxes for additional income streams.
        Can't get any simpler, right? And guess what - you're making a difference for the local environment! &#127795;
      </p>

      <p>
        During your first five sessions, collecting litter in any regular sized plastic bag will do.
        If you want to continue after this, we will provide you with a starter kit containing individually numbered Plonka-branded
        environmentally-friendly plastic bags as well as your choice of working gloves or a picker.
      </p>

      <h1>Who pays for all this?</h1>
      <p>Don't worry - we're not here to rip you off. You won't get rich,
        but Plonka is a really quick way for you to get a legitimate job -
        no language skills or previous experience required.
        Our goal is to get sponsored from a variety of environmentally conscious superstars,
        such as the local government, companies working on their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), and donations from local eco-ninjas.
      </p>

      <p>
        And why would they want to pay for someone to pick up litter, you ask? Simple - providing social benefits
        is expensive, and this is a scalable way of providing jobs for pretty much any able-bodied nature-lovers.
        Additionally, it keeps the local neighborhood clean and safe, both for pets and local wildlife, decreases
        local poverty, and provides a sense of responsibility for the local environment.
        So, instead of donating a half a goat (the front or the back, I wonder..?) to a family in
        a developing, why not help someone closer, while also keeping your neighborhood clean?
      </p>

      <p>
        The people behind Plonka get paid for the time they put in, but this is not meant to be a
        venture-backed unicorn headed for Mars - we just want to make the world a slightly more fair place.
        In order to do this, we reserve a maximum of 10% for our own salaries, marketing, and keeping the initiative running -
        everything else will go to our Plonkers! We aren't bonkers, just a little na√Øve, we promise.
      </p>
