        <p>Truly sustainable gig work</p>

          <p>
            Plonka presents job opportunities that are available instantly to almost anyone.
            No interviews, automated paperwork, and payment for performance, rather than time,
            means that our service can work for anyone. All we require is that workers are
            physically able to collect litter, can follow basic instructions, and have access
            to a smartphone with a dataplan. The rest is up to the Plonker, such as when and where to work.
          </p>
          <p>
            We offer the equivalent of roughly 100 SEK per hour (depending on work performance),
            and cover insurance while working. For many people, this is an opportunity to go from
            unemployeed to making some money on the side - instead of (or in combination with) digging through
            bins in search of recyclable bottles and cans. We probably can't offer an alternative
            to a full-time job, but an important step towards self-sufficiency and dignity.

          <h1>Economically sustainable</h1>
          <p>
            By operating as a social initiative, rather than as a profit-maximizing startup,
            we can offer competitive rates for cleaning up litter in the local area.
            The service and business components scale well, meaning that the founders
            themselves often don't need to put in any time whenever a new Plonker signs up.
            As a result, we only take enough for us to cover internal salaries and development,
            and the rest goes towards providing job opportunities.

          <h1>Environmentally sustainable</h1>
          <p>
            By cleaning up litter in public areas, we make sure to keep parks and woodlands
            naturally beautiful, while minimizing the risk of harm to the local wildlife and pets.
            To some degree, the work put in by our Plonkers minimizes the amount of micro-plastics
            found in nature.
