          <h1>Ready to join Plonka?</h1>
          <p>
            We're honored! Unfortunately, Plonka is currently just a web design project made for
            a university course. The goal is to also create a basic Android app to create a somewhat
            functional MVP to show off how this service could actually work.
            Very little time has been put into the legalities and viability of operating a business with this
            economic model.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if you want to try the MVP app out,
            feel free to register a minimal "de-activated" account which will allow you to log onto the MVP app.
            Note that you won't be able to actually make any money through the app with such an account!
            We may also use your email address and/or phone number to reach out if actually do launch commercially.
          </p>
