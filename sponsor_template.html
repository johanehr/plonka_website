      <h1>Let's be transparent.</h1>
      <div class="text_columns">
        <p>
          Plonka relies solely on goodwill from companies or individuals who want to provide
          safe and sustainable job opportunities to people in the local community, by letting
          Plonka users, known as Plonkers, clean up litter in the vicinity of their homes.
          This is meant to keep common areas, such as parks, naturally beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plonkers join our platform for a variety of reasons, whether it is to supplement
          their income in times of need or simply because they want to clean up their local
          environment. Our goal is to provide an always-available, no-questions-asked job
          opportunity for able-bodied individuals who may otherwise struggle to find a job,
          whether due to limited experience, lacking social skills, or other reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          By recording the worker sessions using both GPS-coordinates and a low resolution video
          feed, we are able to verify that actual value has been delivered by paying per bag
          filled with litter, without putting any time pressure on the Plonker.
          Plonkers are able to work wherever and whenever it suits them, without having to stick to a schedule.
          In short, Plonka strives to be accessible for pretty much anyone with a smartphone, whether
          said person is just wants an additional reason to go out and care for their neighborhood
          in their free time or uses Plonka as a replacement for a traditional job.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h1>We take care of all the administration.</h1>
      <div class="text_columns">
        <p>
          Anyone who is at least 18 years old and has a valid personal number, can use BankID to sign up
          to work for Plonka through our automated on-boarding process. We take care of all the legal paperwork,
          provide a basic insurance while on the job, and handle salaries. This means that companies or the
          local municipality can use Plonka for any cleaning up that needs to be done, without any of the hassle.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h1>So what is our cut?</h1>
      <div class="text_columns">
        <p>
          Plonka isn't striving to make big money, although we operate like a startup. We take a flat fee of
          10% of all sponsorship money to cover development, internal salaries, legal work, marketing, etc.
          The rest goes to our Plonkers or to the people currently manually verifying each clean-up session.
          Plonka also qualifies as a social enterprise, which means that no sales tax is necessary (uh, there's a slim chance at least...).
        </p>
        <p>
          It won't make us rich, but we aim to make the world a slightly better place for everyone involved.
          The Plonka platform has been built from the ground up to be highly scalable, which means that once we
          are fully up and running, the company will operate with minimal costs, and providing the maximum possible
          benefit to the local community - both people and the environment.

      <h1>Here's how you can help!</h1>

          Does everything sound good so far? Fantastic!
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a company, please get in touch with us using the contact details below, and we'll send you an invoice.
          The information we need from you is the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Company name and tax number</li>
          <li>Sponsorship sum (50 SEK fills one 10L bag)</li>
          <li>Center GPS coordinate(s) or address, and a radius (0.5-5km) for your clean-up zone(s)</li>
          <li>Whether you want to receive the GPS and video information from your zone(s)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Note that, if a clean-up session spans across multiple overlapping zones,
          the Plonker's salary will be paid proportionally to the time spent in each zone.
          Once a zone's remaining designated sponsorship money reaches less than 50 SEK,
          the remaining money is moved to a nearby zone to allow for full bags of litter to be collected.
        </p>
